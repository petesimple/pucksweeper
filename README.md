🟡🔴🟢 PuckSweeper

PuckSweeper is an 8bit air hockey–themed take on classic Minesweeper.
Clear the table, read the pucks, avoid the mallets, and try not to blame the table when things go sideways.

Built as a fast, mobile friendly PWA with a retro PC vibe.

Minesweeper, but for air hockey people.
Pixel perfect. Slightly unhinged.
Always play puck.
